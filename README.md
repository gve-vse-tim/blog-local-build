# GVE-VSE-TIM Blog Build Environment

A nice Vagrantfile to deploy and setup a Fedora cloud image so that
I can locally test my Jekyll-based github.io web content.

## Details

- Once the Vagrant box is up and running, you'll need to connect into
  the environment and launch the local Jekyll server.

```bash
$ vagrant ssh
[vagrant@localhost]$ cd site
[vagrant@localhost]$ bundle exec jekyll serve --host=$MYHOST

```
- The local Jekyll server is portmapped to http://localhost:4000 for viewing the site content.
